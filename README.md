# Mobile-App-NFC
**Currently does not display values from Read on the page, only prints them out in console**
It's an issue that will not be difficult to fix, but I am currently working on getting both the DidDetect and DidDetectTags methods to get hit in the IOS NFC. DidDetect gets the NFC message, and DidDetectTags gets the NFC tag (to be able to write), but for some reason they can't both get hit during the same scan. Will look for a solution ASAP.
